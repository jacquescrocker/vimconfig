My MacVIM Setup for the Textmate Convert

to use:
- clone this repo somewhere (I have it at ~/Vim/config)
    
    mkdir ~/Vim
    git clone git://github.com/railsjedi/vimconfig.git ~/Vim/config

- symlink the vim files to where you cloned it
    
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config ~/.vim
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

- clone my awesome snippet repo (or fork it and clone your own) 

    git://github.com/railsjedi/snipmate-snippets.git ~/Vim/snippets
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/snippets ~/Vim/config/snippets


--------

What I have configured:
- Pathogen: for easy adding/removing/updating of plugins (they go in the ~/.vim/bundle/ directory)

- NerdTree: file manager

- SnipMate: for textmate style snippets

- NerdCommenter: comment/uncommenting for source code

- VividChalk: great looking color scheme (looks exactly like VibrantInk on textmate)

- Surround: tools to easily surround/modify wrapped blocks of code

- vim-cucumber: helps vim work better with Cucumber

- vim-rails: helps vim work better with Rails

- vim-haml: helps vim work better with Haml

- ack.vim: for project wide searching

- unimpaired: no idea what this does

- endwise: no idea what this does

- abolish: no idea what this does

- repeat: no idea what this does
